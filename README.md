# The Math Game

The Math Game is a two player game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

## Details
Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they answer a question wrongly. At the end of every turn, the game outputs the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

The game does not end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game will announce who won and what the other playerâ€™s score is.
